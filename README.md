This is reboot of my [FolderBuilder](https://github.com/adamfoneil/FolderBuilder) project to modernize and simplify some things.

The point of this is to take any `IEnumerable<T>` and convert it into a recursive folder structure. I'm using it as part of [KnowledgeBase.RCL](https://github.com/adamfoneil/KnowledgeBase.RCL) to present a list of routes as a tree view, grouped by folder.
